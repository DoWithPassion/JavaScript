# JavaScript

## Execution Context
  - Everything in the javascript happens inside an Execution Context.
  - It can be considered as a container in which whole javascript code is executed.
  - It has 2 components in it.
      1. Memory Component
        - It is the place where the variables and functions are stored in the form of key value pairs.
        - It can be also known as **Variable environment**.
      2. Code Component
        - It is the place where our code is executed line by line as it is a single threaded.
        - It can be also known as **Thread of Execution**.
### JavaScript is a Synchronous Single-Threaded Language.
  - As it is a single threaded language, js can execute only one command at a time.
  - Synchronous single threaded means that js can execute one command at a time and in a specific order which means it will only goes to next line if it executed the current line.
